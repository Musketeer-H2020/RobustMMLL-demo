# RobustMMLL-demo

Demonstrations of the [Robust Musketeer Machine Learning Library (RobustMMLL)](https://github.com/Musketeer-H2020/RobustMMLL) using [Musketeer's pycloudmessenger](https://github.com/IBM/pycloudmessenger/)

## Installation

You may install pycloudmessenger and other library dependencies as follows:

`pip install  https://github.com/IBM/pycloudmessenger/archive/v0.4.0.tar.gz`

The pycloudmessenger package requires a credentials file to access the cloud service. Please, place the `musketeer.json` credentials at the `demos/demo_pycloudmessenger/`folder.

## Content (available demos):

### POM1:

* **NeuralNetworks**: Multiclass Classification demo on the MNIST dataset


The output files are stored in the corresponding `results/` folder.

## Usage

You need to install the [RobustMMLL library](https://github.com/Musketeer-H2020/RobustMMLL):

`pip install git+https://github.com/Musketeer-H2020/RobustMMLL.git`
