	Install instructions under Linux OS
=====================================================================================

- It is adviceable to install a python distribution like Anaconda (Python 3.7). Please proceeed to the Anaconda download page (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and follow the instructions according to your Operative System

- Once Anaconda is correctly installed, open a bash/dash terminal and execute the following commands:

conda update conda

conda update anaconda

- First, make sure that you have installed graphviz-dev, otherwise run the following commands:

sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y graphviz-dev

- Next, from the root directory of the repo, we create a conda environment:

conda create --name RobustMMLL_demo python=3.7.4

- Activate the environment:

conda activate RobustMMLL_demo

- Install the requirements:

pip install -r requirements.txt

You may need some assistance from a System Manager if you fail to install the Python required libraries.
